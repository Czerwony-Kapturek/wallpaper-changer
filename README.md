# Wallpaper Changer


### What is it?
A small and primitive utility for setting desktop wallpaper images.

### But why?
Windows 10 lost support for separate wallpapers on multiple monitors. It is possible to bring 
the old support back from dead, but it doesn't work well when docking and undocking a laptop, 
especially in configurations with multiple monitors of various sizes and aspect ratios.

### Code features
* Single C++ file
* Needs only basic stuff to build: free Community VisualStudio will do
* EXE size less than 100kB
* Simple '90s style code, so it is easy to modify or repair if there is a need ;)

### Functionality
* Setting random jpeg images from a specified directory as wallpapers
* Option to respect screen's aspect ratio
* Option to prefer the same or different images on multiple monitors
* Timer for changing wallpapers periodically
* Option to start the program when the user logs in

### Usage
1. Place EXE wherever you like
2. Start the program
3. Find program icon in tray, right-click for "Settings..."
4. Configure and enjoy!
